There is promising albeit equivocal evidence that aerobic exercise (AE) engagement increases hippocampal volume and enhances memory in humans. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of AE on hippocampal volume, memory, and cardiovascular fitness (CRF) in cognitively unimpaired, healthy older adults. We performed meta-analyses with random-effects robust variance estimation models and meta-regression analyses.
